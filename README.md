# Intro

This is a project for CPLN6800 at UPenn. The purpose of my capstone project is to understang the association between infrastructure and women’s public safety in New York City. 

In new york city, unfortunately, there were more than 200 thousand incidents of violence against women during 730 days. And 25.88% of incidents happended in public places. So I focused on 25.88%, which means the location of crime, in open areas and transportation places. In 2022, a UK National Statistics survey showed that 32% of women feel unsafe in public spaces at night. Also, women were 10% more likely than men feel unsafe in subway. 

# Background
According to James Scott’s theory in 1988 and Michael Mann’s concept of infrastructure power in 1984, infrastructure is one of the primary instruments the state uses to organize society. There are many different forms of infrastructural violence and gender inequality in the way that our cities are planned. 

Gender power relations are constantly being rearranged, reshaped, embodied, and embedded in even the most common urban infrastructures. The fact that public infrastructures in urban spaces are touched and experienced physically reinforces the idea of infrastructural violence, forcing women to contend with the limitations imposed by time and space. Fear of violence can undermine women’s confidence and limit their activity accessibility in public spaces. 

It is unacceptable that women should be forced to give up their right to access public spaces out of fear. For example, female cyclists are more concerned about overall safety than male cyclists. Additionally, it has an impact on women’s activity duration, which means women are able to remain outside until late in the evening without feeling anxious or depressed because of the darkness. 

Therefore, the requirements for women’s safety must be taken into consideration when developing infrastructure. Characteristics providing prospect, escape, and sufficient lighting should already be considered at the early stage of infrastructure planning. 

A good public space atmosphere in a neighborhood has, from the point of view of giving women a sense of being safe and comfortable, the following characteristics:
- Sufficient illumination: Street lighting affects people’s perception of safety, and people prefer the light in their own surroundings. Proper street lighting is a major factor in enhancing street safety. Research showed that fears in relation to these features might be reflected on campuses and public spaces (‘Hot spots’ of fear and crime), where policy calls for the lighting of dark pathways, and lighting and cameras in parking lots.

- Openness: Unobstructed views and ample space with good all-around visibility ensure safety ahead.

- Utilizing public facilities freely: It refers to the freedom to use public amenities like public restrooms, take public transit, walk alone, ride a bicycle, and so on.
Social Interaction: Activities are accessible for women within walking distance. It takes a lot of energy for women to address safety issues before they
can start enjoying a safe, active lifestyle.

# Analysis
So in my study, I took serveral features into consideration: pavement condition related to walking experience, broken streetlight related to dark street at night, vacant buildings related to insecure surroundings, and access to transportation places. 

Then I found some correlation between those factors and number of crimes. Correlation does not imply causation, but the closer women are to these areas, the higher the probability of an accident. Additionally, public crime impact on public life. Accessibility to public facilities and women's supportive resources are also included in my study. 

# Discussion
Statistics can help us figure out the critical factors in violent incidents. But we can conclude slightly different perspectives by different methods. Indeed, criminology is complicated by human factors. Spatial analysis can dig out invisible truth but is limited. My study is a reference for those who are working as decision-makers or urban development advocates in order to design a city that works for women. 

As noted by Leslie Kern, cities have predominantly been built, designed, and planned by men, leading to a male-centric perspective on urban functioning and design. This reinforces the importance of incorporating diverse perspectives, including those of women, in the process of urban planning and development. By doing so, we can create more inclusive, safe, and equitable urban spaces that accommodate the needs and preferences of all inhabitants, fostering a more just and harmonious society.
